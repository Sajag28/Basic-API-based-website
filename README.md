# Basic-API-based-website
This is my personal project where I have used HTML,CSS and Primary Focus on Javascript.
Here I have used the flex for above bar.
Bootstrap for carousel
CSS properties
Javascript DOM manipulation
All the concept of creating, selecting and updating the dom elements to display.
REAL Time weather API is used to fetch the data of a custom city by using GET method of API.
Also here I have used grids in javascript to display the content in better manner.\
Further more Hosting for this website would be done along with modification and beautification of the site enavbling all the content to work efficiently.
